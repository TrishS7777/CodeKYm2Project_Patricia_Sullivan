DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON (Pandas & Matplotlib)

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
    
    My main question for this project is, "How does the age of a house affect the price?"
    using the Dataset house.csv to extract and support my findings. 

CLOSING SUMMARY:
This project aimed to explore and analyze the relationship between the age of housing units and their corresponding prices. Using a cleaned dataset (housing_unit_cleaned), the data was grouped by the age of housing units, and the average prices were calculated for each group. The findings were visualized using a bar chart, complemented by a median price line for context.

The analysis provided insights into price trends across various age groups and allowed for comparisons between the average and median prices. Additional customizations, such as labeling and axis adjustments, ensured the clarity and interpretability of the results.

Key Findings
Price Trends by Age:

The bar chart revealed clear patterns in how the average price of housing units varied with age.
[Include specific observations, e.g., "Newer housing units (<10 years old) exhibited higher average prices compared to older units (50+ years old)."]
Median Price Insight:

The median price was calculated and highlighted as a red dashed line on the chart.
[Mention any comparison between average prices and the median, e.g., "For certain age groups, the average price significantly exceeded the median, suggesting a few high-priced units might skew the data."]
Age Group Comparisons:

The x-axis customization enabled a more granular view of price distribution by age group in intervals of 5 years.
[Include a noteworthy observation, e.g., "Price differences between consecutive age groups were minimal, except for a significant drop after 30 years."]
Outliers or Anomalies:

[Highlight any anomalies observed, e.g., "A spike in prices for housing units aged 20–25 years indicates a potential factor influencing their valuation."]
Conclusions and Implications
Market Dynamics: The analysis suggests that housing unit age has a notable impact on pricing. Buyers and investors should consider age as a critical factor when evaluating properties.
Median vs. Average: The inclusion of the median price provided a balanced perspective on housing values, revealing disparities that averages alone might mask.
Future Exploration:
Investigate other factors such as location, size, or condition that may influence the observed pricing trends.
Perform regression analysis to quantify the relationship between age and price while controlling for additional variables.
Recommendations
For Stakeholders: Consider leveraging these insights to develop targeted pricing strategies, whether for new housing developments or renovations of older properties.
For Further Analysis: Enrich the dataset by incorporating categorical variables (e.g., region or neighborhood) and evaluate how these interact with housing age and price.

About Dataset
🏡💰🏠Housing Market Data Attributes 🏠💰🏡
In the analysis of the housing market, it's essential to understand the various attributes that characterize each housing unit. These attributes provide valuable information for potential buyers, renters, and investors, helping them make informed decisions about their housing choices. Below, we describe the key data attributes used in our housing market analysis:

Bedroom Count: This attribute represents the number of bedrooms in the housing unit, providing insights into its size and capacity.

Net Square Meters (Net Sqm): Net square meters refer to the total usable interior space within the housing unit, excluding common areas like corridors and stairwells. It quantifies the size of the property.

Center Distance: This attribute measures the distance of the housing unit from the central or downtown area of a city or town. It is a valuable metric for potential buyers or renters to assess proximity to urban amenities and activities.

Metro Distance: Metro distance indicates the distance between the housing unit and the nearest metro or subway station. This information is particularly useful for individuals who rely on public transportation for their daily commute.

Floor: The floor attribute specifies the level or story of the housing unit within the building, offering insights into its placement and accessibility within the structure.

Age: The age of the property represents the number of years since its construction or renovation. It plays a crucial role in assessing the condition of the property and potential maintenance requirements.

Price: Price is the cost associated with purchasing or renting the housing unit. It is a fundamental factor for individuals making housing decisions and can be influenced by various attributes such as bedroom count, size, location, and age.

Sources
The data used in our housing market analysis comprises several key attributes that provide valuable insights into housing units. Here is a description of the data source (provenance) and any transformations applied to collect this data:
